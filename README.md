# high-heart
Experimental Ghost theme, based on [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper), to rehouse an old PHP-based blog/fantasy league project.

Uses [isotope](https://github.com/metafizzy/isotope) to display league table on the index page alongside bricks with post summaries.

'The Ghost of High Heart' is an obscure ASOIAF minor character.

## Installation

Download into your `ghost/content/themes/` directory, `cd high-heart`, and `npm install`.
